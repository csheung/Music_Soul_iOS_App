# Kpop Soul
Kpop Soul is an iOS app developed using SwiftUI, which leverages the Spotify Web API to showcase K-pop (Korean) artists and their albums. The app provides an immersive experience for K-pop fans by offering a seamless and intuitive interface for browsing and discovering their favorite artists and albums.<br>

Upon launching the app, users are presented with a login and signup page, where they can either sign in using their existing Spotify account or create a new one. This integration with Spotify ensures a personalized experience tailored to the user's music preferences.<br>

Once signed in, the Home page displays a searchable table view of various K-pop artists. Each artist entry includes essential information such as their name and profile picture. By selecting an artist from the list, users are navigated to a dedicated artist page.<br>

The artist page features a visually appealing collection view of the artist's albums, accompanied by the artist's icon and a brief introduction at the top of the view. Users can further explore individual albums by clicking on them, revealing additional information and enhancing their overall K-pop experience.<br>

Kpop Soul aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging platform for K-pop enthusiasts, making it easy to explore and enjoy the vibrant world of Korean music through the power of the Spotify Web API. By integrating features like account authentication, artist search, and album exploration, Kpop Soul delivers a rich and interactive experience for its users.<br>

## Overview
### Description
This app shares the latest information on artists with users and could be used to build a community for users interested in the same artists. It could be potentially used to meet new friends or organize an artist's supporters' association. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as Bumble, Spotify, QQ music or other similar apps.Â Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Gathers comments and opinions of music lovers, helps people keen on exploring new music, users can leave comments and provide information for other users
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much they love discussing music and commenting on different artists. They may look at others' comments and share their thoughts on their favorite musics. Notifications will be set to remind them to come back to look at comments of their favorite music.
- **Scope:** First, we would start with showing users a list of different artists and the users can click to select different artists to view all their albums. Users may use the search bar to look for their target artists or albums. After selecting a particular album, users who has signed up and logged in can see the likes and comments from other users, and they can also leave their comments there. This could potentially evolve into a music sharing application like Spotify, Apple Music, QQ music, or other music-related applications by broadening its usage.
